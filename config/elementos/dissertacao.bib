	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a machine learning approach for forecasting hierarchical time series. When dealing with hierarchical time series, apart from generating accurate forecasts, one needs to select a suitable method for producing reconciled forecasts. Forecast reconciliation is the process of adjusting forecasts to make them coherent across the hierarchy. In literature, coherence is often enforced by using a post-processing technique on the base forecasts produced by suitable time series forecasting methods. On the contrary, our idea is to use a deep neural network to directly produce accurate and reconciled forecasts. We exploit the ability of a deep neural network to extract information capturing the structure of the hierarchy. We impose the reconciliation at training time by minimizing a customized loss function. In many practical applications, besides time series data, hier­ archical time series include explanatory variables that are beneficial for increasing the forecasting accuracy. Exploiting this further information, our approach links the relationship between time series features extracted at any level of the hierarchy and the explanatory variables into an end-to-end neural network providing accurate and reconciled point forecasts. The effectiveness of the approach is validated on three real-world datasets, where our method outperforms state-of-the-art competitors in hierarchical forecasting.},

	abstract = {Hierarchical forecasting is needed in many situations in the supply chain to support decision making. Top-down, bottom-up, and optimal linear combination methods are common in hierarchical forecasting. There is no universally optimal solution for hierarchical forecasting, and each method has some advantages and disadvantages. While top-down and bottom-up methods use only the information at the top and bottom levels, respectively, linear combinations use the individual sales forecasts from all series and levels and combine them linearly, often outperforming the conventional top-down and bottom-up methods. These methods do not directly utilise the explanatory information such as price and promotion status that may be available across different levels in the hierarchy, and their performance may be impacted by these external factors. We propose to use a multi-output regression model that utilises the explanatory variables from across hierarchical levels to simultaneously generate forecasts for all the series at the bottom level. We perform an in-depth analysis of 55 sets of fast-moving consumer goods time series and 3049 products of the M5 forecasting competition data. Our results show that our proposed algorithm effectively utilises explanatory variables from across the hierarchy to generate reliable forecasts for different hierarchical levels, especially in the presence of deep promotional discounts.},

A temporal hierarchy can be constructed for any time series by means of non-overlapping temporal aggregation. Predictions constructed at all aggregation levels are combined with the proposed framework to result in temporally reconciled, accurate and robust forecasts. The implied combination mitigates modelling uncertainty, while the reconciled nature of the forecasts results in a unified prediction that supports aligned decisions at different planning horizons: from short-term operational up to long-term strategic planning. The proposed methodology is independent of forecasting models. It can embed high level managerial forecasts that incorporate complex and unstructured information with lower level statistical forecasts. Our results show that forecasting with temporal hierarchies increases accuracy over conventional forecasting, particularly under increased modelling uncertainty. We discuss organisational implications of the temporally reconciled forecasts using a case study of Accident \& Emergency departments.},

We call these “hierarchical time series”. They are commonly forecast using either a “bottom-up” or a “top-down” method. In this paper we propose a new approach to hierarchical forecasting which provides optimal forecasts that are better than forecasts produced by either a top-down or a bottom-up approach. Our method is based on independently forecasting all series at all levels of the hierarchy and then using a regression model to optimally combine and reconcile these forecasts. The resulting revised forecasts add up appropriately across the hierarchy, are unbiased and have minimum variance amongst all combination forecasts under some simple assumptions. We show in a simulation study that our method performs well compared to the top-down approach and the bottom-up method. We demonstrate our proposed method by forecasting Australian tourism demand where the data are disaggregated by purpose of travel and geographical region.},

	abstract = {Key to ensuring a successful tourism sector is timely policy making and detailed planning. National policy formulation and strategic planning requires long-term forecasts at an aggregate level, while regional operational decisions require short-term forecasts, relevant to local tourism operators. For aligned decisions at all levels, supporting forecasts must be ‘coherent’, that is they should add up appropriately, across relevant demarcations (e.g., geographical divisions or market segments) and also across time. We propose an approach for generating coherent forecasts across both cross-sections and planning horizons for Australia. This results in significant improvements in forecast accuracy with substantial decision making benefits. Coherent forecasts help break intra- and inter-organisational information and planning silos, in a data driven fashion, blending information from different sources.

Such combinations offer coherent reconciled forecasts, improved forecasting performance and aligned decision-making. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical forecasting approach based on machine learning. The proposed method allows for non-linear combinations of the base forecasts, thus being more general than linear approaches. We structurally combine the objectives of improved post-sample empirical forecasting accuracy and coherence. Due to its non-linear nature, our approach selectively combines the base forecasts in a direct and automated way without requiring that the complete information must be used for producing reconciled forecasts for each series and level. The proposed method is evaluated both in terms of accuracy and bias using two different data sets coming from the tourism and retail industries. Our results suggest that the proposed method gives superior point forecasts than existing approaches, especially when the series comprising the hierarchy are not characterized by the same patterns.},

In particular, a general framework is established that nests many existing popular reconciliation methods within the class of projections. This interpretation facilitates the derivation of novel theoretical results. First, reconciliation via projection is guaranteed to improve forecast accuracy with respect to a class of loss functions based on a generalised distance metric. Second, the Minimum Trace (MinT) method minimises expected loss for this same class of loss functions. Third, the geometric interpretation provides a new proof that forecast reconciliation using projections results in unbiased forecasts, provided that the initial base forecasts are also unbiased. Approaches for dealing with biased base forecasts are proposed. An extensive empirical study of Australian tourism flows demonstrates the theoretical results of the paper and shows that bias correction prior to reconciliation outperforms alternatives that only bias-correct or only reconcile forecasts.},

	abstract = {Forecasting a large set of time series with hierarchical aggregation constraints is a central problem for many organizations. However, it is particularly challenging to forecast these hierarchical structures. In fact, it requires not only good forecast accuracy at each level of the hierarchy, but also the coherency between different levels, i.e. the forecasts should satisfy the hierarchical aggregation constraints. Given some incoherent base forecasts, the state-of-the-art methods compute revised forecasts based on forecast combination which ensures that the aggregation constraints are satisfied. However, these methods assume the base forecasts are unbiased and constrain the revised forecasts to be also unbiased. We propose a new forecasting method which relaxes these unbiasedness conditions, and seeks the revised forecasts with the best tradeoff between bias and forecast variance. We also present a regularization method which allows us to deal with high-dimensional hierarchies, and provide its theoretical justification. Finally, we compare the proposed method with the state-of-the-art methods both theoretically and empirically. The results on both simulated and real-world data indicate that our methods provide competitive results compared to the state-of-the-art methods.},

Many of these tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with different terminology. This book describes the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of color graphics. It is a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interested in data mining in science or industry. The book's coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks, support vector machines, classification trees and boosting---the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in any book.This major new edition features many topics not covered in the original, including graphical models, random forests, ensemble methods, least angle regression \& path algorithms for the lasso, non-negative matrix factorization, and spectral clustering. There is also a chapter on methods for ``wide'' data (p bigger than n), including multiple testing and false discovery rates.},

	abstract = {Financial time series forecasting is, without a doubt, the top choice of computational intelligence for finance researchers from both academia and financial industry due to its broad implementation areas and substantial impact. Machine Learning (ML) researchers came up with various models and a vast number of studies have been published accordingly. As such, a significant amount of surveys exist covering ML for financial time series forecasting studies. Lately, Deep Learning (DL) models started appearing within the field, with results that significantly outperform traditional ML counterparts. Even though there is a growing interest in developing models for financial time series forecasting research, there is a lack of review papers that were solely focused on DL for finance. Hence, our motivation in this paper is to provide a comprehensive literature review on DL studies for financial time series forecasting implementations. We not only categorized the studies according to their intended forecasting implementation areas, such as index, forex, commodity forecasting, but also grouped them based on their DL model choices, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Deep Belief Networks (DBNs), Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM). We also tried to envision the future for the field by highlighting the possible setbacks and opportunities, so the interested researchers can benefit.},

Banks enjoy higher cumulative adjusted returns (CARs) when they hit analyst consensus only in the crisis. EM is evident pre- but not during the crisis – it has no CAR effects. FG increases the probability of hitting benchmark earnings and during the crisis yields higher CARs. EM and FG act as complements in the crisis period.},

At that time I was head of a provincial bank in the northern part of Sweden – Sundsvallsbanken. I had been at that bank for ten years. Before that I was a professional economist, head of a major research institute and an associate professor at the University of Stockholm. I did not have any practical business experience and knew nothing about banking, but after 10 years in Sundsvallsbanken, I had learned a lot and developed some firm ideas about how to run a bank with a large network of branch offices.},

	abstract = {In time series predictor evaluation, we observe that with respect to the model selection procedure there is a gap between evaluation of traditional forecasting procedures, on the one hand, and evaluation of machine learning techniques on the other hand. In traditional forecasting, it is common practice to reserve a part from the end of each time series for testing, and to use the rest of the series for training. Thus it is not made full use of the data, but theoretical problems with respect to temporal evolutionary effects and dependencies within the data as well as practical problems regarding missing values are eliminated. On the other hand, when evaluating machine learning and other regression methods used for time series forecasting, often cross-validation is used for evaluation, paying little attention to the fact that those theoretical problems invalidate the fundamental assumptions of cross-validation. To close this gap and examine the consequences of different model selection procedures in practice, we have developed a rigorous and extensive empirical study. Six different model selection procedures, based on (i) cross-validation and (ii) evaluation using the series’ last part, are used to assess the performance of four machine learning and other regression techniques on synthetic and real-world time series. No practical consequences of the theoretical flaws were found during our study, but the use of cross-validation techniques led to a more robust model selection. To make use of the “best of both worlds”, we suggest that the use of a blocked form of cross-validation for time series evaluation became the standard procedure, thus using all available information and circumventing the theoretical problems.},

A classificação metodológica da pesquisa foi de ordem exploratória com abordagem qualitativa. Os resultados demonstraram que, embora a fraude fosse difícil de ser descoberta a empresa de auditoria externa Delloite poderia ter se esforçado mais na busca de respostas quanto às demonstrações contábeis, ou ao menos ter exposto os seus limites e dificuldades quanto à análise dessas demonstrações através de um parecer com ressalvas. Espera-se que com o presente estudo possa contribuir para o estudo de fraudes, do por que elas acontecem, de suas características, assim como a atuação da auditoria interna e externa em tais casos, e também proporcionar uma reflexão quanto à responsabilidade do auditor nesse tipo situação.

The methodology consisted in studies of Brazilian cases with the data collection criteria from three law suits. The methodology used was the Contents Analysis The samples were chosen according to the impact those cases had in Brazil and the facility to access their law suits. Therefore, we chose Gallus Agropecuária S/A, Encol S/A and Banco Santos S/A for a matter of convenience. The evidence indicated that in those three cases, the court was convinced by the accounting fraud due to omission of relevant financial information in the balance sheet, by information provided to the market that didn¿t reflect the healthy of the company (assets written up without the property). It was identified as well that, in those three cases, there was condemnation not only for the accounting fraud per si, but also by the combination of other crimes as money laundering, fraud gang, material and ideological false fraud, and bankruptcy.},

Real world data and a simulation study show that the elastic net often outperforms the lasso, while enjoying a similar sparsity of representation. In addition, the elastic net encourages a grouping effect, where strongly correlated predictors tend to be in or out of the model together. The elastic net is particularly useful when the number of predictors (p) is much bigger than the number of observations (n). By contrast, the lasso is not a very satisfactory variable selection method in the p≫n case. An algorithm called LARS-EN is proposed for computing elastic net regularization paths efficiently, much like algorithm LARS does for the lasso.},

The purpose of the research was to reduce the overall forecasting burden by developing and assessing schemes of disaggregating forecasts of a total product line to the related individual items. Measures were developed to determine appropriate disaggregated methodologies and to compare the forecast accuracy of individual product forecasts versus disaggregated totals. Several of the procedures used were based upon extensions of the combination of forecast research and applied to disaggregations of total forecasts of product lines. The objective was to identify situations when it was advantageous to produce disaggregated forecasts, and if advantageous, which method of disaggregation to utilize. This involved identification of the general conceptual characteristics within a set of product line data that might cause a disaggregation method to produce relatively accurate forecasts. These conceptual characteristics provided guidelines for forecasters on how to select a disaggregation method and under what conditions a particular method is applicable.},
